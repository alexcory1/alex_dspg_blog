# Data Exploration
I spent a lot of time this week doing data exploration. I found the USDA food atlas data set, as well as the Economic Census data. I also explored the TinyUSDA package.

# Client Meeting
This week I met with our clients, where we clarified the scope of the project, discussed the goals moving forwards, and shared our progress. I shared about the USDA food atlas and Economic Census data sets

# SQL learning
This week I spent time learning PostgreSQL on DataCamp. I also did several other courses related to data visualizations and fundamental statistical skills.
