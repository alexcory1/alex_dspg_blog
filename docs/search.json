    "text": "Week Seven\nWeek Seven was all about automation. I spent a ton of time parsing strings and doing data wrangling in order to automate tasks. I started this week completing the automation for the rural population function. When I was making the rural population function I realized a ton of the code I need for it will be used in other functions, which led me to make the Pop_Binder function, which creates a new data frame from an address with the populations for all the cities in the county. This is based on work I did last week and work from Jay Maxwell. The big change in this function was that I went from giving it a town name to giving it an address. Dealing with addresses caused me to make a function for parsing Google Maps addresses. This function will be used by both Harun and me. Both Pop_Binder and Address_Parser will likely be used in an initialization function that will run before the rest of the toolkit and save as a global variable. I also worked on the Distance_Test file, which is an RMD file that I am using to figure out how to automate the Pct_County function. This function needs to convert from GPS to UTM coordinates because they are a more useful form because they are an actual distance measurement. Lastly I made the Metro Population function, which returns the population of the city that the address is in. This is used in one of Srika’s functions."

I started off learning about Voronoi polygons. After learning about that as a way of finding geographic area, I read sections out of two books, Community Economics by Ron Shaffer and Community Economic Analysis. These had information about something called Reilly’s Law of Gravitation.

    "text": "One of the main functions of the app is estimating the market size, so we can figure out how many people would potentially shop at the proposed store. Using geospatial and demographic data we were able to make a model to generally estimate how many shoppers might be in the store’s market area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the map being generated by the R Shiny scipt after being given an address. Blue regions denote city boundaries, and green circles show store locations.\n\nThe estimating market size section is broken down into three main components: metro population, rural population, and cities population.\n\n\n\n\nTidyCensus is a package that allows developers to easily retrieve and work with data from the US Census Bureau. The Census Bureau conducts the decennial census every ten years, which is a complete count of the population. They also do a annual survey called the American Community Survey, which is a sample of the population taken with a greater level of socioeconomic detail.\n\n\n\nMetro Population is the population of the city that the potential store would be in. This function uses the parsed address to select just the city the store is out of a data frame containing the population of all the towns in the county that the store is in.\n\n\n\nCities Population is all the nearby cities populations. This function uses a TidyCensus call to find the population of all the cities in the state, and then filters it down to be just the cities in our area. It then takes the sum of all the city populations to determine how many people are in nearby towns.\n\n\n\nRural Population is the population of all people who live in the market area but do not live in a town. This is calculated by finding the population of the whole county, and subtracting the people who live in all the towns in that area, then multiplying by the percentage of the county the area covers.\n\n\n\n\nThe area calculations used in our functions are derived by finding the distance to the nearest store in each quadrant (NE, NW, SE, SW). We divide that distance by two to account for the other store’s market area, then we use that distance as the radius of a quarter circle to figure out how much reach the store has. A more elegant solution to this would be Voronoi polygons, Reilly’s Law of Retail Gravitation, or Huff’s Model.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Voronoi diagram is a way of partitioning a plane into cells where all points within the cell are closer to a given seed, or in our case a store, than any other seed. Implementing these would be beneficial in order to get a more accurate model that scale to the number of neighboring stores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReilly’s law is an economic principle that states that people are more drawn to areas with a higher population than those with smaller populations. This is an excellent way to estimate market area, but is somewhat complicated. Maps are usually edited by hand to account for geographic barriers such as rivers, and there are various limitations such as the populations of the two cities having to be relatively similar.\n\n\n\nHuff’s law is a probabilistic model for estimating consumer attraction. It states that the attractiveness of a store and the something called distance decay determine the likelihood of someone visiting the store. Distance decay is the idea that as people move farther and farther away, the likelihood exponentially decreases that they would visit the store. In the real world this would mean that even though a store might be 10 times more attractive than another, if it is 10 times farther away, they most likely will not travel to it."
